ðŸ‘‹ Hey you! This is the source for [Showhaus](http://www.showhaus.org), a local concert aggregator.

### Getting Started

To set up your own  instance of Showhaus, you can use [this install script](#). This should automatically install and configure most of the stack.

Once you do that, there's a nifty bash script called ```bash.sh``` that initiates a local server and runs a SASS compiler. You can find it in the home directory.

### APIs

This is coming soon. We're still working on documenting the Showhaus API, but you can view a sample of it's output [here](#).

### Issues and Contribution Guidelines

You wanna contribute? Cool! Any bug fixes or feature enhancements should be discuessed in [the issues tab](https://github.com/showhaus/showhaus_angular/issues).
