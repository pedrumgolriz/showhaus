  <h2>About Showhaus</h2>
  <p>Showhaus is an <a href="#">open-source</a> local show aggregator designed and developed by Luis Queral and Pedrum Golriz.
  <h3>Aggregation</h3>
  <p>Shows are aggregated through <a href="#">user submissions</a> and from our list of <a href="#">show feeds</a>.
  <p>Feeds are largely user-submitted and comprise of the Facebook pages of bands and venues. Periodocially, Showhaus scrapse these pages for new events and displays them on the site. This method allows us to scape shows not found on traditional ticketing or concert API's.
  <p> Speaking of API's, we have one too. Learn more about it <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
