  <h2>ABOUT</h2>
  <p>Showhaus is a resource for daily concert listings in the New York City area. We are a small team of dedicated volunteers aiming to make local music accessible to all. </p>
  <h3>Aggregation</h3>
  <p>Shows are aggregated through <a href="#!post">user submissions</a> and from our list of <a href="#!feeds">show feeds</a>.</p>
  <p>Feeds are user-submitted and comprise of the Facebook pages of bands and venues. Periodocially, Showhaus will scrape these pages for new events and display them on the site. This method allows us to scape shows not found on traditional ticketing or concert API's.</p>
